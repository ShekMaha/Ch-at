This proposal is fine and should be able to be achieved in the time you have
left.

Some unclear points:
- Do professors (i.e. admins) add their courses to the listings? Can other users
  create chat rooms as well?

A few thoughts (feel free to ignore):
- Fully anonymous users might be a bad idea, as it may lead to misbehaving
  users. An alternative would be "Anonymous to Students", like Piazza.
- Your sketch doesn't include how admin-related tasks will work, but I'm
  assuming they'll just be additional screens/menu options.
- If you have time, considering making it responsive, so that students that who
  don't bring laptops could also use it on their phones.
- Could optionally have a feature that allows people to queue up questions for
  the instructor.

Unrelated to the proposal:
- Make sure all your dependencies are listed in package.json so that we can get
  it up and running easily when marking (e.g. socket.io)
